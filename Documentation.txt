Andrew Przybocki Technical Interview 
May 26, 2021

Description: I developed this project on a Ubuntu Windows WSL. I used Flask to created the API and used Gunicorn to host it. The user interface is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP and hosted using an apache2 server. I made the majority of my design decisions based on the limited experience I have with web development. I figured I should stick with what I know. 

Note: I did not complete the assignment in the allotted time. I spent the majority of my time debugging the API, trying to get it to serve the frontend with forecast data. I was able to render it within my local VS code enviorment, but not on the deployed apache2 server. 

Requirements:

Install Apache2:

Install Flask:

Install Gunicorn: 
https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/install.html

To run this project (Ubuntu):
1. 'sudo service apache2 start' - (This should get the user interface up and running locally)

2. 'source venv/bin/activate' from within the 'flask_app' folder - (This will enable a virtual enviroment which should keep your workspace clean)

3. 'gunicorn app:app' from the flask_app folder - (This should get the API up and running locally)
